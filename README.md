# ComposableOS

**ComposableOS** is a plug-and-play smart wallet framework that lets you build fully customizable wallets using secure, on-chain modules. Whether it's spending limits, 2FA, session keys, or social recovery — every feature is a module, and every wallet is uniquely composable.

## Features

- Security-Centric Design – Add 2FA, spending rules, or signer rotation.
- Gas-Efficient Deployment – Uses EIP-1167 Clones via a wallet factory.
- On-Chain Configuration – Modules are initialized with setup payloads.
- Developer-Friendly – Build your own modules and extend the OS.
